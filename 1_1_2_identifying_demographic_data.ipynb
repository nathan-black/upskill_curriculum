    "Demographic data describes who someone is and doesn't change as often as other types of data. When using demographic data to describe a person, caution should be taken to not overgeneralize demographics to other attributes that describe a person such as their behaviors, attitude, or opinions. Demographic data is recorded and tracked when using everyday applications. The value of demographic data is its ability to store insights about (mostly) immutable characteristics of a person"
