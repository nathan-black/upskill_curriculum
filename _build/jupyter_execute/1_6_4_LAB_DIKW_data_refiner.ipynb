We recommend using open-source and readily accessible tools such as Spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, etc.), Python, R, or SQL. If the organization you work for commonly uses one of these tools or another proprietary tool, learners may use the same tool in the lab. However, default learning resources in QuantHub will consist of material covering open-source technologies."
