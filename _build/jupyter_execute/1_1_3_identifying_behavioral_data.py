An advantage of behavioral data over other forms is that it describes actual actions regardless of who performed those actions or feelings or emotions surrounding the actions.

# ## Learning outcomes
# 
# Learners will be able toâ€¦
# -	Understand what behavioral data is
# -	Identify behavioral data attributes
# -	Identify how behavioral data is tracked and collected
# -	Use behavioral data to describe a person's actions

# ## Learner-facing goals
# 
# Let's learn how behavioral data is used to describe what people do

# ## Lesson plan

# ### Warmup activities
# 
# - Describe what you did yesterday
# - Watch [Four Reasons to Care About Your Digital Footprint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro_LlRg8rGg)
#     - What are some advantages of having a digital footprint?
#     - What are some drawbacks?
#     - What do you wonder about your digital footprint?

# ### Exercises
# 
# **What behavioral data can you find?** Learners view an image, dataset, or graph and find behavioral data attributes and values.
# 
# - Select the behavioral variables in the dataset:

# In[1]:


import pandas as pd
marketing_campaign = pd.read_csv("datasets/marketing_campaign_data.csv")
marketing_campaign_sml = marketing_campaign[["Year_Birth", " Income ", "Kidhome", "Teenhome", "Dt_Customer", "NumWebPurchases", "NumWebVisitsMonth", "Country"]]
marketing_campaign_sml = marketing_campaign_sml.head()
marketing_campaign_sml["SatisfactionRating"] = [8, 10, 5, 2, 6]
marketing_campaign_sml['Lifestyle'] = ["Foodie", "Outdoor Enthusiast", "Fisherman", "Musician", "Gamer"]
marketing_campaign_sml.columns = ["Year_Birth", "Income", "Kid_at_home", "Teen_at_home", "Sign_up_date", "Web_purchases", "Monthly_web_visits",  "Country", "Satisfaction_rating", "Lifestyle"]

# - Select the behavioral attributes that describe the image:
# 
# ![music](./images/listening_to_music.jpeg)

# **What would happen if things were different?** Learners view a dataset, graph, or image describe how changes would impact the behavioral data values being produced or recorded.
# 
# - Match the change with the impact to the behavioral data in the table:
# 
# Changes
# 1. A customer signs up
# 2. A customer quits their job
# 3. A customer makes a purchase on the company website
# 
# Impacts
# 1. A new row is added to the table with a corresponding sign-up date
# 2. Change to income which is a demographic variable not a behavioral variable
# 3. Web_purchases increases by 1 for that customer
#

# **What behavioral data will be created?** Learners are provided with a data collection mechanism or scenario and describe the behavioral data that will be generated.
# 
# - Match the data collection device with the behavioral data being tracked:
# 
# 1. Sensor on a coffee maker
# 2. Traffic camera
# 3. Customer Relationship Management(CRM) system
# 4. Fitness wristwatch
# 5. Political poll
# 6. Ecommerce website
